# Weekly AI News Summary

<think>
Okay, let's see. The user wants me to summarize AI news articles into markdown format. The instructions specify including the date in IST, a concise summary, sorting by date (latest first), and the source URL as a link. The example provided has a specific structure with ### [Date] followed by bullet points.

First, I need to go through each article provided and extract the relevant information. The user provided several articles with content, URLs, and dates. However, some articles have multiple URLs listed, like the second article from the user which lists several URLs. I need to check which URL is the correct one. For example, the second article has a main URL and several references like [1], [2], etc., but the main URL seems to be the one from ainvest.com.

Next, I need to parse the dates correctly. The dates are in GMT, but the user wants them in IST. Since IST is UTC+5:30, I need to convert the given GMT dates accordingly. For example, the first article's date is Tue, 02 Sep 2025 06:30:38 GMT, which would be 12:00 PM IST. But since the example in the user's message shows the date as 2025-09-02, I should just convert the date to the IST date, not the time, unless specified. All dates provided are in GMT, so converting them to IST date by adding 5 hours and 30 minutes. However, for the purpose of the summary, the user probably just wants the date in YYYY-MM-DD format in IST, so I can convert the GMT date to IST date without the time. For example, a GMT date of 01 Sep 2025 06:53:00 would become 01 Sep 2025 12:23 IST, but the date remains 2025-09-01.

Now, I need to summarize each article concisely. The first article is about Reliance launching a new AI subsidiary and partnerships with Google and Meta. The summary should mention the new subsidiary, the partnerships, and the data centers. The second article talks about Reliance and Google's AI cloud region, but the URL seems to be different. Wait, the second article's content mentions multiple URLs but the main one is from ainvest.com. The summary should focus on the key points like the AI cloud region in Jamnagar and the partnerships. Then there's the OpenAI planning a data center in India, reported by Bloomberg and Reuters. The government's plan to fund AI models, the U.S. and Indian VCs forming a $1B alliance, Mitesh Khapra's recognition, AI in agriculture, and others.

I need to sort all these articles by date, latest first. The latest date is 2025-09-06 for the Fox News and SHRM articles, then 2025-09-04 for the IIT Madras professor and SHRM article, etc. Then, for each date, create a section with the summary and the URL. Also, ensure that each summary is a concise sentence or two.

I also need to check if any of the articles are duplicates or have overlapping content. For example, there are two articles about Mitesh Khapra from different sources (Indiablooms and DNA India), but they are both from the same date. I should combine them into one entry if they are about the same topic. Similarly, the articles about Reliance and Google/Meta partnerships are in different entries but related.

Another thing to note is that the user provided a mix of articles with valid content and some that seem to be placeholder or test content (like the Fox News AI newsletter and the SHRM article about the four-day workweek). I need to ensure that only the valid articles with real content are included.

Finally, after organizing all the articles by date, I'll format them into the specified markdown structure, making sure each summary is concise and the URLs are correctly linked.
